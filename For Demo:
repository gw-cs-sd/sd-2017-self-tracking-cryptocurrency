For Demo:

	Get the communication back with the server --> set up a socket that works and passes a currency across
	Get the encryption decryption system to start only sending and storing encrypted data 
	Database 
	Client Server communication 
	encrypting the token with a random pad in it that cant be copy and pasted to be used
	Splitting Token two --> 
	summarize the expense report 
	WORK OUT AN EXAMPLE --> transactions going through several people and then where the numbers are


For Winter Break 
	Get the currency to start communicating with a database 
	Get the Currency to start implementing with a UI and Play 
	Set up relationship diagrams that can be used to present 
	Set up a system that makes the currency completely anyomous 
	Look into how the currency could be used to actually buy things and be used in a market 

Wrapping the socket in an ssl socket 
Communicate with the database (can assume that anything that runs on the server is secure --> connection betwen the code and the database)
From client to server need to address 
Splitting ability 
To know how it was given but not who --> after one degree
