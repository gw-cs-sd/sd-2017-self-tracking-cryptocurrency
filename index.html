						Self-tracking cryptocurrency will create a unique ability for users to track and restrict digital transactions.  This will allow businesses, organizations and individuals across the world to facilitate secure transactions with ease. 
						By specifically designing an interface for two user types: the payee and the receiver, the system will efficiently give the functionality of tracking the transactions of the cryptocurrency, while also giving the payee the functionality 
						to restrict how the funds will be used.  Once the receiver has utilized the funds, the payee will be sent a notification confirming funds were spent appropriately.  The restriction, tracking and verification functionalities of the cryptocurrency 
						are the distinguishing factors that set this currency apart from systems that already exist.
