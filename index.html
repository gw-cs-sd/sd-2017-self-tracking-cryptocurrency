						<strong>Project Background:</strong><br>
						
						<br>Self-Tracking E-Currency creates a unique ability for users to track and restrict digital transactions.  This allows businesses, organizations, and individuals across the world to facilitate secure transactions with ease. 
						By specifically designing an interface for two user types: the payee and the receiver, the system will efficiently give the functionality of tracking the transactions of the currency, while also giving the beneficiary the functionality 
						to restrict how the funds are utilized.  Once the receiver has utilized the funds, the allocator will be sent a notification confirming funds were spent appropriately.  The restriction, tracking and verification functionalities of the e-currency 
						are the distinguishing factors that set this currency apart from other e-currencies on the market.
